What do you mean create sales ?

In the system or sent invoices ?

Why are we doing August enteries only now ? 

> Create Sale of Equitas for month of Nov-24, RBL Bank for the month of Dec-24, Piramal Finance for the month of Aug-24, And IDFC for the month of Oct-24 To Dec-24(various States Like:- Delhi,West Bengal, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan,& Telangana)

Rati,

Can you please give me an iodate as what’s actually going on with the accounting enteries. 

Need to see actual revenue for both DF and Cf for each month. Need Jan figure as well.

We need to discuss with you your assignments and how you can report about
the work more effectively.

Also, Please don't use all capitals in the emails, It's the equivalent of
