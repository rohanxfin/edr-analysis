Let's plan a section on the App and website which has tools for Dealerships
at once place. ( Or Sellers)

1. Mask the Number plate and Add dealer logo. ( we can offer logo resizing
option), or nxcar, For Sale or  plain blank fuzzy plate as additional
options.
2. Generate Car Scope. ( from Basic Inputs)
3. Price Prediction:  Nxcar Greenbook ( from our flow)
4. Generate AI created SoMe content for a car to be listed. ( Blurbs,
Animated Videos, Posts, You tube video, AI insights)
5. RC Check/ Data , National Crime Bureau Check, Challan Check
8. Transfer Document set generation by filling forms once.  (Get a set and
instructions from Munender)
9. Inspection Template / Checklist with tick marks and generate report.


Please plan and start the design and development. Most are integrations and
adding links to the separate page."
