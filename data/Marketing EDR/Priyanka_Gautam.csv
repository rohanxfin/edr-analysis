We received 5 of them. And the other inquiries related to vouchers were also taken care of. We have received the list of dealers for Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad,Delhi, Kolkata. The digital copies of the certifcates are ready for them. As per discussion with Dinesh, we will stick to our existing certificate vendor to maintain brand consistency. I have asked the vendor to have some sort of brackets for the certificate’s life. I have also ordered the samples for both shirts and T-shirts, which I am expecting to receive in the next few days. Once we are happy with the quality, we will proceed with the order. Apart from that, I have asked Ragini to create our Hackathon live and have discussed the rules and directions for the event. Rizwan will execute it with Ragini’s help and my assistance. Our stories on our Main page are now active. We have observed, 5-6 link clicks on every story and also received Inquiry regarding one of the cars posted on the platform. As per discussion with Ankush for our Google ads, we need to now fix our landing page for ads optimisation, which we will discuss with Prakhar. Also, to make our Google buy car campaigns more effective, we have asked Ankush to connect with us GTM team in creating visitors to conversion events. *Best Regards,* *Priyanka Gautam* *Marketing Manager*[image: Logo.png] https://www.nxcar.in/ <https://nxfin.in/"

I also worked on the press release copy shared in the separate email. And made a few QR codes for Anjali to use in the LED posters. If we receive the full list with dealer pages link, we will create the digital versions tomorrow itself. For certificates, I spoke to Nitin for providing certificates with clamps on the corners. He will also provide samples for tshirts. On Tue, 13 May 2025 at 20:06, Priyanka Gautam <priyanka.gautam@nxfin.in"

Tshirt samples: received T-shirts samples from Sanjay today, their isn’t much difference in the cost of the T-shirts with customisation and gst. Also, the quality of the tshirt shared by the previous vendor is better. I am awaiting the tshirt samples in Dinesh’s size for quality assessment and expecting them by tomorrow. 2. Certificates: the certificates ordered were placed yesterday itself. I have selected the ‘white’ Color brackets to go with the certificates for durability. In total 174 certificates ordered have been placed, they are expected to be delivered by next Wednesday 3. Post our discussion with the Analytics, the signed NDA has been sent to the team. 4. LED : I have sent the list of 97 dealers for their information to Dinesh. We require it for dealer page creation. The remaining digital copies are ready 5. Presentation for onboarding - I assisted Anika in presentation which has been shared in the group. Also, I am working the voice over and content requirement for the tutorial videos. The listing video tutorials will be shared tomorrow. *Best Regards,* *Priyanka Gautam* *Marketing Manager*[image: Logo.png] https://www.nxcar.in/ <https://nxfin.in/"

I have corrected the names and locations for each dealership. Additionally, I generated UTM links and traceable QR codes for every dealer for LEDs and certificates. I have shared the list of dealers with missing information with Dinesh for verification.

I have completed 70% of the work and expecting to share the draft by Monday first half. Along side I am working on the seller marketing communication for better conversion. I’ll share the templates for email, sms and WhatsApp by first half tomorrow. Additionally, I have provided the voiceover script to Anika for feature video tutorials. The videos will be shared on Monday. Once done, we will share their YouTube links with RMs and snap4u team. I haven’t received the samples of the tshirt and shirts that I ordered for testing yet. I have asked the vendor to send them at the earliest. Certificates list has also been shared with Dinesh for verification, which is awaited. I have also sent tha RTO booklets for printing, will get them on Monday itself. For LEDs, the digital copies are ready, however, some of the dealers information is still missing to create their dealer page. If needed , we can add website QR code for speeding up the process.
