Started with Low-Level Approach for Price Modeling - Focused on building the price model for one specific make: Maruti Suzuki. - Currently considering 19 unique models and 97 unique variants (as per Neeraj Sir’s email from yesterday, I am strictly following the listings on our platform, word for word). - Why only 19 unique models and 97 variants? - I have sufficient data (multiple rows for these combinations), which simplifies model training. - Data for other variants is unavailable. - These models and variants are the most common according to our data analysis. - Completed end-to-end preprocessing and data cleaning for these 19 models and 97 variants. - Trained the baseline model, which is giving fair accuracy. Next Steps After Baseline Validation: - If the model achieves good accuracy: 1. We will validate our approach, which will guide future efforts. 2. I will scrape more data for additional models and variants to expand the scope. 2. Loan Project Handover - Completed the top-level handover for the Loan Project from Anshul. ------------------------------ Plan for Tomorrow: 1. Perform hyperparameter tuning to refine the model and provide concise accuracy scores. 2. Improve the model further by: - Adding more data or scraping additional relevant data. - Incorporating additional parameters into the model. 3. Review and go through Anshul's project in greater depth. Regards, Rohan Khandelwal"

However, for some instances, it provides inaccurate results. - The transformer model is pretrained, making it reliable, but since it is a black-box model, there’s no room for manipulation to improve accuracy in edge cases. *Samples:* Regards, Rohan Khandelwal On Fri, 21 Feb 2025 at 18:31, Rohan Khandelwal <rohan.khandelwal@nxfin.in"
