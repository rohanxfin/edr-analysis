I believe that it meets the basic requirements that we initially outlined. Moving forward, I think we can start working on the statements and insights that we want to present. We can delve deeper into the insights, explore suggestions for other car options, and potentially expand into areas where we discuss additional features. I hope to schedule a meeting with Neeraj Sir and Prakhar Sir to discuss these next steps. Prakhar Sir, regarding your concern about Streamlit, I believe that it is the most efficient option given my current coding skills. I am confident that I can find a solution to work with Streamlit and have my project ready for testing. Also, wishing the Product team a Happy Holi! Best Regards, Ragini Pant"

I've been focusing on identifying key insights that could enhance user engagement with our platform. Specifically, I've been researching the types of information that would be most valuable and interesting to our users. My research has included identifying and understanding: *Technical Insights: Body style, Mileage (ARAI), Engine, Transmission, Seating Capacity, Engine Type, Turbocharge/Supercharge, Steering Type, NCAP Rating, Airbags, Seatbelt Warning, Anti-lock Braking System, and Hill Hold Control. * Additional Features: Central Locking, Child Safety Locks, Air Conditioner, Keyless Start/Button Start, Cruise Control, Seat Adjustment, Ventilated Seats, Cup Holders, Sunroof, Fog Lights, USB Compatibility, Wireless Charger, Aux Compatibility, Bluetooth Compatibility, iPod Compatibility, and Voice Command. 2. In addition to identifying these insights, I've also been exploring the best ways to visually represent them. I'm researching which types of graphs and charts would most effectively showcase this information and allow users to easily compare cars based on these features. Also working on how to compare cars based on these features and how to portray this information on our platform. 3. Finally, I've started working on the code implementation to bring these insights to life. Best Regards, Ragini"
