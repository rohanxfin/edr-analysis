1. Locations appearing that has no cars. 
We should not have locations appearing on home page of there are less than 10 cars for that place. Else we can have larger groupings like state. 

2. Some cases the old list is not refreshing, when a location is selected that has no cars Lome Bhatinda, and if prior location was Jaipur, it would show 36 cars in Bhatinda while showing Jaipur inventory. 


3.City Clusters need to be reworked. For example Panchkuka should show. Chandigarh cars and Noida should show Delhi NCr cars. 

4. Some listings are appearing without the seller / dealership name

5. Loan amount / EMI / Downpayment

While you start please sow and sometime in understanding the approach we have adopted in selecting variants in our listings as these probably will need to relate to pricing data obtained from diverse sources. 

Any price discovery mechanism must take the accurate variant in account, there should not be any contamination across variants.

How big is the reference data set, I could not see many variants. Is it
limited to main models?

Representation looks nice, let's have a demo tomorrow.  What will be needed
to move this from streamlit to our own hosting for API connectivity.

For EOL edge cases, you may need to have separate logic, in most cases
price drops significantly irrespective of the make/model during the last 2
years to life. most price curves will converge around 2-3 lac Rs.

Let's plan a section on the App and website which has tools for Dealerships
at once place. ( Or Sellers)

1. Mask the Number plate and Add dealer logo. ( we can offer logo resizing
option), or nxcar, For Sale or  plain blank fuzzy plate as additional
options.
2. Generate Car Scope. ( from Basic Inputs)
3. Price Prediction:  Nxcar Greenbook ( from our flow)
4. Generate AI created SoMe content for a car to be listed. ( Blurbs,
Animated Videos, Posts, You tube video, AI insights)
5. RC Check/ Data , National Crime Bureau Check, Challan Check
8. Transfer Document set generation by filling forms once.  (Get a set and
instructions from Munender)
9. Inspection Template / Checklist with tick marks and generate report.


Please plan and start the design and development. Most are integrations and
adding links to the separate page."

Implementation looks good, it’s most distinct feature of our listing platform. No one has it.
